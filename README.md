# SPIRO

SPIRO comprises six sets of 3D printable structural parts. Sets 3a and 3b are for alternative setups that include either ArduCam IMX219 or raspberry pi v2 camera, respecitvely.




# Recommendations for 3D printing

All models were tested on Prusa MK2S printer using black matt PLA filament from MatteForge. We recommend using matt filament to minimize reflections on images.
Printing all parts will take hundred and some hours of non-stop printing. For convenience, parts that can be printed together are combined into sets. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Set 1</b> includes following structural parts:<br />
a. one motor hub<br />
b. three bearing guides<br />
c. one housing for a mini microswitch<br />
d. one tiny dick (pin for the mini microswitch)<br />
e. two caps and f. two bottoms for assembling two thumb screws<br />
g. one corner for mounting vetical rail<br />
h. one mounting tool for LED-frame rails<br />

<br />
Set 1 should be printed without brim or any supports. <br />
For structural purposes 20% infill and draft quality (0.35 mm thickness of vertical layers) is sufficient.<br />
Printing the set with the draft quality should take ca 7.5h. <br />
Printing with 0.2 mm vertical layer thickness will have only esthetical benefits and will take ca 12.5h.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Set 2</b> includes following structural parts:<br />
a. one borgs/birds nest (housing for the electronics)<br />
b. one lid for the nest<br />
c. one holder for the SparkFun Mosfet kit<br />
d. one lid for the DC connector<br />

<br />
Set 2 should be printed without brim or any supports. Removing supports will be an oustandigly unpleasant task, I cut up myself real bad with the screwdriver <br />
For structural purposes 20% infill and draft quality (0.35 mm thickness of vertical layers) is sufficient. <br />
Printing the set with the draft quality should take ca 10.5h. <br />
Printing with 0.2 mm vertical layer thickness will have only esthetical benefits and will take ca 17.5h.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Sets 3</b> include following structural parts:<br />
a. one camera house for raspberry pi v2 camera (set 3a)  for ArduCam IMX219 (set 3b) <br />
b. one lid for the camera for raspberry pi v2 camera (set 3a)  for ArduCam IMX219 (set 3b)<br />
c. two caps and two bottoms for assembling two thumb screws<br />
d. set 3a also includes an extra support for the raspberry pi v2 camera to prevent it from tiliting during manual focusing<br />

<br />
Set 3 should be printed without brim or any supports. <br />
For structural purposes 20% infill and normal quality (0.2 mm thickness of vertical layers) is sufficient. <br />
Printing set 3a should take ca 2h, printing 3b takes ca 4.5 h <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Set 4</b> includes following structural parts:<br />
a. one cube
<br />

<br />
<br />
Set 4 should be printed without brim or any supports. <br />
For structural purposes 20% infill and normal quality (0.2 mm thickness of vertical layers) is sufficient. Lower print quality leads to rougher surface that will be visible on the images. Higher infill might make the cube to heavy for the stepper motor. <b>sic!! Please make sure that the cube's bottom is on the printing bed. for this you will currently need to rotate it by -90 degrees on the x axis </b> (I will try to fix it in the stl file, for some reason, unlike other parts the damn cube is not responsive to changing axis in Fusion 360). <br />
Printing should take ca 28h.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Set 5</b> includes following structural parts:<br />
a. one left half of the screen

<br />
<br />
Set 5 should be printed with a brim and supports on build plate only <br />
For structural purposes 50% infill and normal quality (0.2 mm thickness of vertical layers) is sufficient. <b>sic!! Please make sure that the screen is placed vertically and diagonally on the printing bed. For this you will currently need to rotate it by -90 degrees on the y axis and 50 degrees on the z axis </b> (I am looking into how to fix its default positioning in the slicer). Make sure the screen is withing the printing volume, and only the brim sticks out. Ignore the error about toolpath being outside the printing volume. </br>
Printing should take ca 20.5h.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Set 6</b> includes following strucural parts:<br />
a. one right half of the screen
